## Tests

Describe: beepBoopify()

Test: "It should return the number that is input"
Code: beepBoopify(123);
Output: 123

Test: "It should return a range of numbers from 0 to the input"
Code: beepBoopify(5);
Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Test: "It should change 1 to "Beep!"
Code: beepBoopify(5);
Output: 0, "Beep!", 2, 3, 4, 5

Test: "It should change any number containing a 1 to "Beep!"
Code: beepBoopify(12);
Output: 0, "Beep!", 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Beep!"
Note: Created contains1() here

Test: "It should change 2 to "Beep!"
Code: beepBoopify(5);
Output: 0, "Beep!", "Boop!", 3, 4, 5

Test: "It should change any number containing 2 to "Beep!"
Code: beepBoopify(5);
Output: 0, "Beep!", "Boop!", 3, 4, 5
Note: DRY'd, changing contains1() to containsX() to account for any value.

Test: "It should change any number containing 3 to "Won't you be my neighbor?!"
Code: beepBoopify(3);
Output: 0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"
Note: Since code was DRY'd containsX already accounts for it in any digit

Test: "It should prioritize 3 then 2 then 1"
Code: beepBoopify(13)
Output: 0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?" ... 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"

Describe contains1()
Note: Not in final product

Test: It should return true if the input is a 1
Code: contains1(1);
Output: true;

Test: It should return true if any digit in the input is a 1
Code: contains1(41);
Output: true;

Describe containsX()

Test: It should return true if the input is a X
Code: contains1(12, 12);
Output: true;

Test: It should return true if any digit in the input is X
Code: contains1(12345, 3);
Output: true;
