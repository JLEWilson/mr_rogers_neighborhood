        <p>It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood</p>
        <p>A beautiful day for a neighbor</p>
        <p>Would you be mine? Could you be mine?</p>
        <p>It's a neighborly day in this beautywood</p>
        <p>A neighborly day for a beauty</p>
        <p>Would you be mine? Could you be mine?</p>
        <p>I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you</p>
        <p>I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you</p>
        <p>So, let's make the most of this beautiful day</p>
        <p>Since we're together, we might as well say</p>
        <p>Would you be mine? Could you be mine?</p>
        <p>Won't you be my neighbor?</p>
        <p>Won't you please, won't you please?</p>
        <p>Please, won't you be my neighbor?</p>
        <p>Neighbors are people who are close to us</p>
        <p>And friends are people who are close to our hearts</p>
        <p>I like to think of you as my neighbor and my friend</p>
