              <p>Since we're together, we might as well say</p>
              <p>Would you be mine? Could you be mine?</p>
              <p>Won't you be my neighbor?</p>
              <p>Won't you please, won't you please?</p>
              <p>Please, won't you be my neighbor?</p>
              <p>Neighbors are people who are close to us</p>
              <p>And friends are people who are close to our hearts</p>
